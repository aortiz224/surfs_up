# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis

To determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round by analysing temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. 

## Results :surfer::icecream:

* The minimum temperature observed in December was 56 degrees compared to 64 degrees in June. This variance can decrease the likelihood of people wanting to consume ice cream.
* The average temperature observed in December was 71 degrees compared to 75 degrees in June, which is very comparable. This tells us that the temperatures are generally very similar across the two months. 
* The mean and the median for both June and December are approximately the same, meaning that the results are perfectly symmetrical and aligned for both months.

## Summary

Based on the results, Oahu has great weather for the surf and ice cream shop to run all year round. I do project sales will be down during the month of December due to cooler minimum temperatures, however, not significantly enough for the shop not to be able to make a profit for the year.

Two additional queries to consider:
* Run a querie for precipitation likelihood during June and December. Rain may impact visitor's decision of surfing.
* Run a querie for weather stations and their frequency of reporting. A weather station that reports more often would have more accurate information on the weather.
